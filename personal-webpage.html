                <p>
                    I'm Sam, but most people online call me fish. I adopted this
                    name a long time ago and it has stuck with me. The name was
                    created on the original Xbox in 2002 for my brother who was
                    an avid fisher and I was only one at the time. My dad
                    created a gamertag for his new Xbox Live profile and the
                    name he came up with was FishboyX24X7X. The name is clearly
                    dated with the use of X's. We eventually started sharing the
                    account and over time I eventually took ownership of the
                    account. Throughout the years the name has been shortened
                    going from FishboyX24X7X to Fishboy and now to fish.

            <p>
                Along with my name I have also had an interesting story to go
                with my profile picture that begins with a Mcdonald's Happy
                Meal. Back in 2005 the Disney movie Chicken Little was releasing
                and had a collaboration with McDonald's in which the characters
                would come included with a Happy Meal. Somehow the Fish out of
                Water character from the movie came into my father's possession.
                At the time he was a teacher and would decorate his room with
                different items and decided he wanted to add it to the room.
                Years later when he was being moved to a new classroom my family
                and I went to help pack up the room and I stumbled across the
                character and thought it would make a fitting profile picture
                for my Xbox account. Since then I have used the name and picture
                for any none professional accounts I own. I don't forsee myself
                coming up with a new or better online persona anytime soon so
                for now it will be a part of me!
