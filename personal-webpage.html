        <!-- 
            Hello Readers! This webpage is a personal page that goes over the 
            story of how my online name and picture came to be. The page also 
            shows my personal favorite color which happens to be blue. When 
            creating the website I redesigned it many times, but knew I wanted 
            to do a blue and white page. I also wanted to create a flow and used
            an svg image to create a transition from the first view to the 
            second. I decided to not have the svg images in the mobile view 
            because it felt cluttered and unintuitive on a small screen and 
            instead opted for one solid background. Another design choice was 
            having an arrow at the bottom right of the screen to take the user 
            to the bottom page or to the top page depending on the respective 
            page. This was modified in the responsive design for mobile devices
            to only have one arrow at the very bottom of the page to take the 
            user back to the top of the page. I chose this approach because
            with the small screen it was hard to understand the layout and how 
            far down the top arrow would take the user. The way responsive 
            design was implemented was through the use of two media queries. The
            first is defining a mobile device as anything 500 pixels or less 
            wide and the other is anything over 500 pixels. The major difference
            between the two is that mobile design is a columnar approach that 
            has text and images in one column while the larger screens is 
            designed in rows. Another design choice is the use of accessibility 
            tags such as title and alt for all images and the use of semantic 
            tags. I also followed guidelines from Web Content Accessibility 
            Guidelines (WCAG) to have the font of text and background have a 
            high contrast. I really enjoyed this project and it really 
            challenged me not in the technical aspects in HTML, but how to make 
            a page look good. I felt the design was the hardest part and I 
            restarted my work many times. What I learned most is that I have a 
            lot to learn about how to design a website!

                <p>
                    I'm Sam, but most people online call me fish. I adopted this
                    name a long time ago and it has stuck with me. The name was
                    created on the original Xbox in 2002 for my brother who was
                    an avid fisher and I was only one year old at the time. My
                    dad created a gamertag for his new Xbox Live profile and the
                    name he came up with was FishboyX24X7X. The name is clearly
                    dated with the use of X's. We eventually started sharing the
                    account and over time I eventually took ownership of the
                    account. Throughout the years the name has been shortened
                    going from FishboyX24X7X to Fishboy and now to fish.

                Along with my name I have also had an interesting story to go
                with my profile picture that begins with a Mcdonald's Happy
                Meal. Back in 2005 the Disney movie Chicken Little was releasing
                and had a collaboration with McDonald's in which the characters
                would come included with a Happy Meal. Somehow the Fish out of
                Water character from the movie came into my father's possession.
                At the time he was a teacher and would decorate his room with
                different items and decided he wanted to add it to the room.
                Years later when he was being moved to a new classroom my family
                and I went to help pack up the room and I stumbled across the
                character and thought it would make a fitting profile picture
                for my Xbox account. Since then I have used the name and picture
                for any non professional accounts I own. I don't forsee myself
                coming up with a new or better online persona anytime soon so
                for now it will be a part of me!
